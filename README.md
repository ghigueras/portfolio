# Project Portfolio | Guillermo Higueras Iglesias
## IT Project Manager (PMP) · Technical Product Owner

PMP-certified IT Project Manager and Technical Product Owner with 15+ years 
delivering complex digital products in energy, edtech and banking. I combine 
the rigour of a certified PM — budget control, EVM, risk management, 
stakeholder alignment — with the technical depth of a Senior Java Engineer, 
which means I can bridge business and development in a way that most PMs cannot.

This portfolio showcases three real projects where I led delivery end-to-end, 
from discovery to production. All cases are anonymised to protect client 
confidentiality.
